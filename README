Market Description:

This simple application helps you convert between beer units, such as Bottles, Pints, Cans, etc. It also lets to know how much alcohol you're drinking (the amount of ethanol contained in your beer).

Example calculation: I want to know how many 5% bottles of beer it would take to equal the alcohol in 2 pints of 6% beer.
I would input:

2 Pints 6%
to
Bottles 5%

You can add your own units from the menu!
